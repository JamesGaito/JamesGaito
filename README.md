# James's ReadMe Github Repository

<!--
**JamesGaito/JamesGaito** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
1. **Previous coding experience**: I did a basic python class for a couple weeks but I really don't remember any of it so I would't really count that.
2. **Reasons for taking this class**: Computer science has always sounded interesting to me but I've never really taken the time to learn it before.
3. **Other interests**: Fencing I guess?
4. **Goals for this class**: Just to try to generally improve my understanding of computer science.
